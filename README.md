# POS-MicroRetailer
Custom made retailer app for LK World Food Programme, that runs on POS Famaco PX400. Contains custom react native modules. 

The app can be built for each retailer, assigning them a unique ID and linking the ID to their relevant beneficiaries through the backend (using Firestore for example). Will check for bluetooth upon opening and automatically pair with Datecs DP-255 Thermal printer. SCOPE ID can be used to log in the old fashioned way, or a QR code with the SCOPE ID can be scanned to skip manually typing in the PIN.
